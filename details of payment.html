<p>
The nisab of zakat is as follows:
<ol>
<li> The cash equivalent to 3 ounces/87.48 grams of gold </li>
<li> The cash equivalent to 21 ounces/612.36 grams of silver </li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
Nisab is the threshold or cut-off amount. If your personal wealth, or what you own, is more than the nisab, you owe zakat. <br>
If your personal wealth is below the nisab, you do not owe zakat. You use the current market price of gold or silver to calculate the nisab. <br>
Zakat is definitely not a tax. It's a spiritual act to help relieve people's sufferings and purify ones wealth. Some people believe that in many countries, paying zakat is voluntary whereas it is mandatory. 
However, this is incorrect. Zakat is very important as it is also the 3rd pillar of Islam.
</p>

<p>
Zakat-eligible assets are:
<ol>
<li> Stocks </li>
<li> Savings </li>
<li> Investment properties </li>
<li> Cash </li>
<li> Business Income or previous metals such as gold </li>
</ol>

However, your primary residence, cars, clothes and business equipment are not included in Zakat-eligible assets. <br>

Only 2.5% of your current zakat-eligible assets should be given in zakat and this should be done every lunar year. It is up to you to fix the date you want to pay zakat.<br>

Also, to ensure that your zakat is going to fellow muslims that are in need, you should donate to a recognised and registered non-profit, interest-free charity organisation. <br>
All this should be done with the consultation of known religious people with great understanding.
