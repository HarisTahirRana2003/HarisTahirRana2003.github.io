        <h1>Travel to Skardu</h1>
        
        <p><strong>Skardu</strong> is a city in <strong>Gilgit-Baltistan</strong> region of Pakistan, and serves as the capital of <em>Skardu District</em>. Skardu is located at the confluence of the Indus and <em>Shigar</em> Rivers at an elevation of nearly 2,500 metres. The city is an important gateway to the eight-thousanders of the nearby Karakoram Mountain range. </p>
        
<h2 class="h2headings"><center> Topography </center> </h2>

<ul> 
<li>The mountain peaks surrounding Skardu reach elevations of 4,500–5,800 metres. Upstream from Skardu are some of the largest glaciers in the world, including the Baltoro Glacier and Biafo Glacier. </li><br> 
<li>Some of the surrounding glaciers are surrounded by some of the world's tallest mountains, including K2, the world's second tallest mountain at 8,611 metres.</li> <br>
<li>The Deosai National Park, the world's second highest alpine plain, is located upstream of Skardu as well. Downstream from Skardu is located the Nanga Parbat mountain at 8,126 metres.</li> </ul>


<h2 class="h2headings"> <center> Climate </center>  </h2>

<p> Sand dunes in the Cold Desert of Skardu are often covered in snow during winter.<br>
Skardu features a <strong>cold semi-arid climate</strong>. The climate of Skardu during the <strong>summer</strong> is <strong>moderated</strong> by its mountain setting; the intense heat of lowland Pakistan does not reach it. The mountains block out the summer monsoon, and summer rainfall is thus quite low. <br>
However, these mountains result in very <strong>severe winter weather</strong>. During the April-to-October tourist season, temperatures vary between a maximum of 27 °C and a minimum 8 °C. Temperatures can drop to below −10 °C in the December-to-January midwinter period. The lowest recorded temperature was −24.1 °C on 7 January 1995.
